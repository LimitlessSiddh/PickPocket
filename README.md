## Authentication

We have moved our authentication from using **only** JWT to now using Firebase as well.
This is done to ensure industry-standard secure authentication as well as to 
implement Google Login. 


## Shift to TypeScript

With the vision of growing this project and eventually getting more devs on board,
we have transitioned over to TypeScript to enhance code quality and maintainability.
